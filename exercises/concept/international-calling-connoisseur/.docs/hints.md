# Hints

## 1. Create a pre-populated hashmap

[Literal maps][hashmap-literals] are represented as alternating keys and values surrounded by `{` and `}`.

## 2. Add a country to a map

The [`assoc`][assoc] function returns a new associative collection with the supplied key(s) and value(s) added to it.
